# SBA-Loan-Approval-Analysis-Prediction

  An SBA (Small Business Administration) loan application will be granted or denied based on a variety of parameters, according to the SBA Loan Approval Analysis and Prediction model, a decision tree classifier. Loan amount, loan type, borrower race, and borrower gender were shown to be the most crucial factors in the model's 94.3% accuracy on the test dataset for predicting loan acceptance. The model can be used to guide future research in this field and offers insightful information about the elements that affect the acceptance of SBA loans. The model might not be able to forecast loan acceptance in all cases, and its accuracy might be affected by changes in the loan approval procedure over time.

**Dataset:**

  The Small Business Administration (SBA) website provided a dataset with more than 2.1 million loan applications submitted between 2000 and 2014, which was used by the SBA Loan Approval Analysis and Prediction model. To make the dataset suitable for the machine learning model, preprocessing was done on it.
  Content: Shape of the data: 899164 rows and 27 columns

**Conclusion:**

  The SBA Loan Approval Analysis and Prediction project's findings were encouraging, and the model that was created showed strong accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
  A testing set was used to evaluate the model, and the results showed 94.6% accuracy, 94.8% precision, 96.0% recall, 95.4% F1-score, and 97.4% ROC AUC. According to these findings, the model may help financial institutions streamline their loan approval procedure, resulting in quicker and more effective decision-making.

  Because of the model's high accuracy, it can frequently anticipate loan acceptance properly, which lowers the risk of false negatives (for example, anticipating a loan won't be authorized when it should be). Because of the model's high accuracy, forecasts of loan acceptance are generally accurate, which lowers the possibility of false positives (i.e., forecasting that a loan will be authorized when it shouldn't be).

Overall, the outcomes of the SBA Loan acceptance Analysis and Prediction study show how well the built model performs when it comes to correctly forecasting loan acceptance based on different input featu  res. The high F1-score, ROC AUC, recall, accuracy, and precision show that the model has the ability to improve the loan approval process for small businesses seeking funding through the Small Business Administration.
